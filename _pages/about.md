My name is Yanbin Yin. I'm a forth year undergraduate student from [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn). 

I am applying for 2025 Fall PhD. My current reserach focuses on large language models (LLMs), aiming to address the following challenges:

- **Foundamental Development:** How to effectively inject knowledge into LLMs through pretraining?

- **Exploitation:** How to elicit the capability and knowledge in LLMs through instruction finetuning?

- **Application:** How to evaluate LLMs’ capabilities, how to improve LLMs’ capabilities by prompting
engineering or LLM reasoning and how to employ LLMs for scientific discovery?

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu) from UCSD and [Prof. XinZhao](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/waynexinzhao) from Renmin University of China.
